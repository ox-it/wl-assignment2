ASSIGNMENT2
*Compatible with Sakai >= 2.7

NOTE: If you are using MySQL as your backend database for Sakai do verify that you have your collation set to a case 
sensitive one (say utf8_bin). Many OS distributions of MySQL default the collation to utf_general_ci.  
Renaming of assignments is a case sensitive thing and we need to make sure the  database is using case sensitive searching.
