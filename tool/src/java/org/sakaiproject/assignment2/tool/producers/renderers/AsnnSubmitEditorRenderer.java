/**
 * Renders the area of the Student Submit pages where the student does the 
 * actual work of putting in the submission text and uploading any attachments
 * that are part of the submission.
 * 
 * This does have to detect the type of assignment: Non-electronic, text,
 * text and attachments, attachments only.  In the future this may be 
 * modularized to allow new pluggable assignment types.
 * 
 * In the non-electronic or non-submission assignment type, this will really
 * just be a check box that says you've completed it and a "Save and Return"
 * button.
