 * This renders the aggregated view of all the submissions from a student for
 * a particular assignment. It does this by using collapsable drop downs for 
 * each version. For each one of those it uses the 
 * {@link AsnnSubmissionVersionRenderer} to render that drop downs content.
 * 
 * This also needs to show some nifty notifications on the title bars for
 * each version if that version has any feedback that has not been read. Also,
 * if any of the aggregated versions have new feedback, an overall notification
 * should be present somewhere at the top of the widget.
